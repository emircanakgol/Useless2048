# Useless2048
A physics based 2048 game that sometimes, becomes annoying ðŸ˜„

### Challenge against unstable physics!
As for the main challenge of the game, expect lots of block misplacements. If you still can score 2048, you are the one!

*(Sound On!)*

This project is made for a homework and has many deficiencies and bugs. So, do not expect a complete gaming experience.
